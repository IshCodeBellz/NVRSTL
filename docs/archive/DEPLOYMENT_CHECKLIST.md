# Production Deployment Checklist

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Requirements

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Completed

- [x] Centralized status management with TypeScript enums
- [x] Comprehensive observability (metrics + health endpoints)
- [x] Sentry error monitoring integration
- [x] Enhanced error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Optimized test infrastructure with serial execution
- [x] Load balancer compatible health checks

### ‚è≥ Email Verification (In Progress)

- [x] Schema updated with verification fields
- [x] API routes created for request/confirm flow
- [x] Email templates with verification links
- [ ] Database migration completion
- [ ] End-to-end testing

### üîß Required Environment Variables

#### Essential (Production)

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db  # Upgrade from SQLite

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

#### Monitoring (Recommended)

```bash
# Error Tracking
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_ENABLED=true

# Performance
VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA=auto  # Vercel auto-sets this
```

#### Payment (When Ready)

```bash
# Stripe (Replace Simulation)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration

```bash
# Switch to PostgreSQL for production
# Update DATABASE_URL in environment
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm run start  # or deploy to Vercel/similar
```

### 3. Health Check Verification

```bash
# Test endpoints post-deployment
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/metrics
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup

- Configure Sentry alerts for error thresholds
- Set up uptime monitoring for `/api/health`
- Create dashboards for `/api/metrics` data

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs

- **Uptime**: > 99.5%
- **Error Rate**: < 1%
- **Response Time**: API < 500ms, Pages < 2s
- **Memory Usage**: < 75% peak

### Business KPIs

- **Conversion Rate**: Track via metrics endpoint
- **User Engagement**: Session duration and page views
- **Order Accuracy**: Payment vs fulfillment matching
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Support ticket volume

## üõ†Ô∏è Post-Launch Tasks

### Week 1

- [ ] Implement advanced rate limiting
- [ ] Plan real Stripe integration

### Quarter 1

- [ ] PostgreSQL migration (if not done pre-launch)
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] A/B testing infrastructure
- [ ] Enhanced audit logging

## üÜò Incident Response Plan

### Error Escalation

1. **Critical** (5xx errors > 10%): Immediate investigation
2. **Warning** (4xx errors > 20%): Review within 1 hour
3. **Info** (Performance degradation): Review daily

### Rollback Procedure

1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Check health endpoint status
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Notify stakeholders

### Communication

- Status page updates for major incidents
- Slack/email alerts for development team
- Customer support notification workflows
