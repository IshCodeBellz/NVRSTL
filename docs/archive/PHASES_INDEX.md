# Phases Archive Pointer

Individual phase documents (Phase 2–4 plans, status, completion, transitions) were removed to reduce noise.

Authoritative timeline & roadmap now live in:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` → Sections 1 (Executive Snapshot) & 15 (Roadmap)
- `CHANGELOG.md` for incremental changes

If a historical phase narrative is needed, retrieve it from git history prior to commit `7cfd972`.

No further phase-specific markdown files should be added; update the roadmap section instead.
