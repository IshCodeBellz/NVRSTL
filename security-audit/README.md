## 🔍 Individual Security Tests

### 1. Core Application Security Audit

Tests authentication, authorization, input validation, API security, data protection, and infrastructure security.

```bash
# Run core security audit
npx tsx security-audit/security-audit.ts --url http://localhost:3000

# Test against production
npx tsx security-audit/security-audit.ts --url https://your-domain.com
```

**Tests Include:**

- 🔐 Authentication security (login, signup, session management)
- 👥 Authorization controls (admin access, user permissions)
- 🛡️ Input validation (SQL injection, XSS protection)
- 🔌 API security (rate limiting, CORS, security headers)
- 🗃️ Data protection (sensitive data exposure, encryption)
- 🏗️ Infrastructure security (dependency vulnerabilities)

### 2. Webhook Security Validation

Validates webhook signature verification and security measures.

```bash
# Test webhook security
npx tsx security-audit/webhook-security.ts --url http://localhost:3000

# Test production webhooks
npx tsx security-audit/webhook-security.ts --url https://your-domain.com
```

**Tests Include:**

- 📝 Stripe signature validation
- 🔒 Endpoint protection
- 📋 Payload validation
- 🔄 Replay attack protection

### 3. SSL/TLS Security Validation

Comprehensive SSL certificate and TLS configuration testing.

```bash
# Test SSL/TLS security
npx tsx security-audit/ssl-security.ts --url https://your-domain.com
```

**Tests Include:**

- 📜 SSL certificate validity
- 🔐 TLS version support
- 🔑 Cipher suite security
- 🔗 Certificate chain validation
- 🛡️ HSTS header configuration

## 🎯 Comprehensive Security Audit

### Run Complete Security Suite

Execute all security tests in a coordinated fashion:

```bash
# Development environment audit
npx tsx security-audit/run-security-audit.ts

# Production environment audit
npx tsx security-audit/run-security-audit.ts --url https://your-domain.com --env production

# Custom configuration
npx tsx security-audit/run-security-audit.ts --url https://staging.your-domain.com --env staging
```

### Security Report Output

The comprehensive audit generates:

- **Overall Security Score** (0-100%)
- **Test Suite Breakdown** (Application, Webhook, SSL/TLS)
- **Severity Analysis** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Actionable Recommendations**
- **Production Readiness Assessment**

## 📋 Production Readiness Validation

### Infrastructure Readiness Check

Validates all components required for production deployment:

```bash
# Check production readiness
npx tsx security-audit/production-readiness.ts

# Check specific project path
npx tsx security-audit/production-readiness.ts --path /path/to/project
```

**Validation Categories:**

- 🏗️ **Core Infrastructure** (Docker, package.json, environment files)
- 🔒 **Security Readiness** (audit systems, middleware, authentication)
- ⚡ **Performance Readiness** (load testing, optimizations)
- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability** (Sentry, health checks)
- 📚 **Documentation & Testing** (README, tests, deployment guides)
- 🌍 **Environment Configuration** (variables, deployment configs)

### Readiness Scoring

- **90-100%**: Excellent - Ready for production
- **80-89%**: Good - Ready with minor improvements
- **70-79%**: Acceptable - Proceed with caution
- **<70%**: Not ready - Significant improvements needed

## 🚀 Master Deployment Orchestration

### Complete Production Deployment Pipeline

The master deployment script orchestrates the entire production deployment process:

```bash
# Development deployment simulation
npx tsx security-audit/master-deployment.ts

# Production deployment
npx tsx security-audit/master-deployment.ts --production

# Staging deployment
npx tsx security-audit/master-deployment.ts --env staging

## 📊 Security Scoring System

### Score Calculation

Security scores are calculated based on:

- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests passing
- **Severity Weighting**: Critical failures heavily impact score
- **Category Coverage**: Comprehensive testing across all security domains

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Status        | Action Required                  |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 90-100%     | 🏆 Excellent  | Maintain current practices       |
| 80-89%      | ✅ Good       | Minor improvements recommended   |
| 70-79%      | ⚠️ Acceptable | Address medium priority issues   |
| 60-69%      | 🔶 Marginal   | Significant improvements needed  |
| 0-59%       | ❌ Inadequate | Major security overhaul required |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Security Audit Failures

**Authentication Issues:**

```bash
# Check authentication endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/session
```

**Database Connection:**

```bash
# Verify database connectivity
npx prisma db push --preview-feature
npx prisma studio
```

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Check environment configuration
cat .env.example
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

### SSL/TLS Issues

**Certificate Problems:**

```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com
```

**TLS Configuration:**

```bash
# Test TLS versions
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 your-domain.com
```

### Performance Issues

**Load Testing Preparation:**

```bash
# Install Artillery.js
npm install -g artillery

# Run basic load test
artillery quick --count 10 --num 100 http://localhost:3000
```

## 📈 Continuous Security Monitoring

### Regular Security Audits

Schedule regular security audits:

```bash
# Weekly security check (cron job example)
0 2 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && npx tsx security-audit/run-security-audit.ts --env production

# Monthly comprehensive audit
0 3 1 * * cd /path/to/project && npx tsx security-audit/production-readiness.ts
```

### Automated Deployment Validation

Integrate security checks into CI/CD:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Security Audit
  run: npx tsx security-audit/run-security-audit.ts --env staging

- name: Production Readiness
  run: npx tsx security-audit/production-readiness.ts
```
